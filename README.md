## Project Description 

The main idea of creating this project at first was to make a project from ground up and get out of tutorial hell.
So I had to use all my UI/UX skills (*which are quite terrible by the way*ðŸ˜­). And oh boy, that was a challenge.
Moving on...
When I was done with HTML and CSS I decided to try React. I did a research on it and started to implement **React** and some of its basics like
Function Components, Hooks, State, Lifecycle and React Routing. It was so much fun to learn something by making a real project with it.

### Technologies that were used
* HTML
* SCSS

* React

You don't have to create any account on this website (*obviously 'cause no server side logic has been implemented*ðŸ™ƒ). Just press *Sing In/Up* button and you'll get right to the dashboard.<br>
And don't forget to click on *Terms of Service* link. There's some additional info about this project.ðŸ˜Ž
